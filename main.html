    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time Complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task, making it more efficient.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory occupied by the program. For example, if a program takes an array of size n, the Space Complexity of the program becomes O(n).</p>
